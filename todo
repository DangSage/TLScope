To connect these ideas and complete the task based on the provided project structure, here's a high-level overview of what you need to do. Implement the core models:

In the Models directory, define your User class and any other necessary model classes.


Set up the database context:

In Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs, create your Entity Framework Core DbContext to interact with the database.


Implement the repositories:

In the Repositories directory, create data access methods in UserRepository.cs for CRUD operations on users.


Develop the services:

Implement the business logic in your service classes:

NetworkService.cs: Handle network discovery and connection management.
TlsService.cs: Manage TLS connections and related security operations.
UserService.cs: Handle user-related operations, integrating with UserRepository.




Create the controllers:

In NetworkController.cs, define the API endpoints or command handlers for network-related operations.


Implement utilities:

In GraphUtility.cs, create methods for graph creation, manipulation, and analysis using QuikGraph.


Design the user interface:

In NetworkView.cs, implement the text-based UI using Terminal.Gui for visualizing the network and TLS connections.


Set up the main program:

In Program.cs, initialize the application, set up dependency injection, and coordinate the flow between different components.


Configure the application:

Use appsettings.json for storing configuration settings like database connection strings, logging preferences, etc.


Implement security features:

Integrate Argon2 for password hashing in the user management process.
Set up proper TLS handling using System.Net.Security.


Add logging:

Implement Serilog for structured logging throughout the application.


Create unit tests:

Write tests for your services, repositories, and utilities using xUnit and Moq.


Implement command-line parsing:

Use CommandLineParser to handle command-line arguments in Program.cs.


Set up the build process:

Configure your project to use the .NET CLI for building and managing dependencies.


Documentation and comments:

Add XML comments to your classes and methods for better code documentation.
